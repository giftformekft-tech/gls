# Woo MyGLS DocSpec

WooCommerce integration for the Hungarian MyGLS REST API. The implementation follows the official specification shipped as
`docs/MyGLS_API.pdf` and cross-checks the reference bundle published as
`mintafile/CSHARP-PHP-JAVA_SOAP-REST_CLIENTS_PUBLISHED_10`.

## Resources
- API specification: `docs/MyGLS_API.pdf`
- GLS sample clients: `mintafile/CSHARP-PHP-JAVA_SOAP-REST_CLIENTS_PUBLISHED_10`

Sync the upstream documents before development so every request payload can be validated against the authoritative sources.
