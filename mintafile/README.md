# GLS Sample Clients

This directory mirrors the structure described in the GLS reference bundle `CSHARP-PHP-JAVA_SOAP-REST_CLIENTS_PUBLISHED_10`.

The upstream package contains C#, PHP, Java, SOAP, and REST client examples that demonstrate the official payload schemas. The
original archive is fairly large, therefore only the folder layout and integration notes are checked into Git. Drop the official
ZIP contents under `mintafile/CSHARP-PHP-JAVA_SOAP-REST_CLIENTS_PUBLISHED_10/` to review the full samples locally.

Refer to `docs/MyGLS_API.pdf` for the specification that the examples implement. When adding the files, remember to commit them or
configure Git LFS if the archive exceeds the regular GitHub upload limit.
