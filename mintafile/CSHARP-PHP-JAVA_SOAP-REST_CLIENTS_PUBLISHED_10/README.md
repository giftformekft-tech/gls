# Placeholder for GLS Sample Archive

Place the official GLS sample client files extracted from the `CSHARP-PHP-JAVA_SOAP-REST_CLIENTS_PUBLISHED_10` package here. The
archive includes language-specific examples (C#, PHP, Java) and SOAP/REST request templates that align with the MyGLS API
specification. Keeping the structure in the repository makes it easier to cross-reference the examples while updating the WooCommerce
integration.
